<h2>Step 3: Read the ticket</h2>

<p>The helpdesk professional will read the ticket in order to gather the important details of the issue described by the user. Here the issue is that Adobe is not working.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Assign a ticket to an IT professional</h2>

<p>Either the queue manager or the helpdesk professional will decide who the ticket will be resolved by. They will assign the ticket to that individual. In this case, the ticket is assigned to Ben. To see tickets that have been specifically to you, click on the 'My Tickets' tab.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Assess the priority of the ticket</h2>

<p>When tickets arrive, the priority will often be initially determined by the user, so it may not have been accurately assessed according to the IT department's criteria. Here, we can read that the issue is that Adobe Reader is not working. As a helpdesk professional, you can determine and set the priority.</p>
